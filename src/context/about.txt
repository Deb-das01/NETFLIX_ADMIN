read carefully or refer youtub videos


Refer to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgp_iCVS8ys


understand the work flow:-

INITIALLY the apiCalls are made from a particular file for accessing

1st:  Inside the apiCalls file a function is being dispatched
2nd:  According to the dispatched type the reducer changes the state of variable in the reducer file
3rd:  In movieContext file the currect state is thus updated according to the state modified by reducer
NOTE: As the last update is performed in the context file so this record is stored and used further
